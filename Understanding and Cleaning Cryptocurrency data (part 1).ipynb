    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back to our tutorial series on Cryptocurrency Analysis with Python! In our previous tutorials, we explored how to use powerful Python libraries such as Matplotlib, mplfinance, and yfinance to load and visualize cryptocurrency data from popular sources like Yahoo Finance. We’ve discussed about cryptocurrency exchanges, trade expenses (visible and hidden costs) and what we should really know about them before you create an account and before you start trading with them. Moreover, we retrieved detailed and in-depth cryptocurrency data from CoinGecko, a popular data aggregator, using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first part of our tutorial, our objective is to delve into the data understanding and cleaning process. We will be working with a dataset retrieved from a data aggregator, which contains complex information about various cryptocurrencies. Our primary goal is to carefully prepare and analyze this data to extract valuable insights into the cryptocurrency market. During this process, we will perform crucial data cleaning operations, including dropping unnecessary columns, filling in missing values, and converting specific date columns to datetime objects. Furthermore, we will explore and understand essential concepts such as market capitalization and Survivorship bias.\n",

    "From the sorted dataframe above, we observe coins that haven't seen updates for quite some time. For instance, the last update for ScopeCoin (XSCP) was back in January 2020. Typically, for actively traded coins, we would expect the last update to be more recent. However, there are also coins that haven't seen updates for an extended period, often because they are no longer actively traded or there is no new market data available. Exchanges commonly delist coins, especially those that have experienced significant price drops, fraud, or other controversies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When working with data from a specific exchange like Binance, you may not find data on removed coins. This phenomenon leads to what's known as **survivorship bias**, a common and significant issue in finance and investing. *Survivorship bias occurs because datasets typically include only the 'surviving' assets, omitting information about those that failed. This isn't unique to the crypto market; it's a challenge in the stock market as well*[1]. This pehomen can lead to incorrect or biased results, particularly in world of cryptos.That's one of the reasons why we prefer to work with data aggregators. These aggregators tend to include data on failed coins, reducing survivorship bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate this with an example [2]. Take the case of `Monetha (MTH)`, a coin that experienced a significant hype in 2018 but was removed from Binance in early 2022 [3]. As a result, you won't find much data on Monetha within Binance, but CoinGecko provides a more comprehensive dataset, including information on where you can still trade Monetha, despite its removal from Binance."

    "In this data understanding and cleaning process, we successfully prepared our dataset for analysis by dropping unnecessary columns, filling missing values, and converting date columns.

    "In our next part, we will delve into reconstructing our dataframe by retaining the most informative columns, finding duplicates, and many more...\n",
